Idea:
try to make a emoji list, and react with one of them to a user photo

if user adds a photo and a comment for e.g '11278' <- group of the exam
the group gets stored in a list or database
so if the group repeats the bot adds the same reaction to the other photo with the same group
and somehow informs the users that they're in the same group.
